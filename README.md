# Password Generator

The project randomly generates a password for the user based on the criteria submitted

## Description

When the user clicks the 'generate' button, they will be prompted to enter how many characters they would like to have in their password. They are then presented with a series of other questions that asks if they would like lowercase letters, upppercase letters, numbers, and symbols in their password. Based on this criteria, their password will be generated and appear in the empty box.
